Fire used everywhere.

Marragon 1791
Marragon proceeded to describe the land as deeply incised: it had tall mountains
side-by-side with deep ravines, steep and rocky, with thick forests difficult to
penetrate because of thickets and vines.

C.T. Hoart, a government surveyor, visited Rodrigues in May 1825. By now the
destruction of the forest seemed to be well advanced. Although primarily
interested in mapping Rodrigues, he wrote rather illegible "general
observations' on Rodrigues (1-loart, 1825), in which he described the caverns
and two sides of the island. He noted that there was no timber in the western
part of the island although on Plaine Corail small trees of "benjoin" Terminalia
and "bois puant" Foetidia were plentiful. He also mentioned rats eating seeds.

Balfour (1874) rodrigues is: "...a dry and comparatively barren spot, clothed
with a vegetation mainly of social weeds, and destitute of any forests growth
save in unfrequented and more inaccessible parts in the recesses of the valley"

Probably the current clearing can be assumed already in 1874


From Gardella
But even before 1800, on the lower
slopes of the northern coast, the original vegetation was being burned off regularly and
being replaced by grass, pandanus, lataniers and palms (Cadet 1975:11).
