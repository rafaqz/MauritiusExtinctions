Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss. Snakes that were encountered on the islands were also shot by early visitors (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Once restricted to Round Island, introduced goats and rabbits denuded the island of much its vegetation and caused extensive loss of soil, thus removing the burrowing boas’ habitat and their likely reptile prey resources. It is also likely that habitat loss would have led to increased predation of juvenile burrowing boas by the endemic Telfair’s Skink <em>Leiolopisma telfairii</em>.",,,Bolyeria multocarinata,"Not much is known about this snake's ecology, but its morphology with a blunt snout and no neck suggests it was a sub-fossorial species (Vinson 1953, 1975). A snake suspected of being a burrowing boa was reported to quickly burrow into holes in the ground (Vinson 1953). Bullock (1977) reported that the individual caught in 1975 burrowed through loose soil and plant material with ease.&#160; It is thought that the boa would have lived primarily in the understorey of hardwood and palm-rich forests (Vinson 1953, Bullock 1977). Its specialized jaw morphology is similar to that of the keel-scaled boa (Frazzetta 1970, Cundall and Irish 1986, 1989) and suggests that it predated terrestrial lizards and ground nesting/burrowing seabird chicks, but maybe also lizard and bird eggs. Dissection of a female specimen at the Zoological Museum, Hamburg showed it to contain five eggs (Hallermann and Glaw 2006).<br/><br/>An individual collected in 1935 measured 85 cm in length; individuals caught in 1953 and 1967 both measured 95 cm in length (Vinson 1975) and the last individual caught in 1975 was 88 cm in length (Bullock 1977). The five museum specimens measure between 54 and 140 cm (Bauer and Günther 2004). Other specimens have been reported to be up to 180 cm in length (Vinson 1949). The dorsal colouration was light brown with small blackish spots, becoming larger and joining towards the posterior of the body, with vertical streaks on the side of the tail and the ventral colour of the snake was pinkish and marbled and tinged with black (Vinson 1975).","This species has not been recorded since 1975 despite active conservation efforts on Round Island. Soil erosion and extensive loss of habitat as a result of introduced herbivores have been blamed for the extinction of this snake. Introduced mammalian predators, principally rats, have been identified as the leading cause of historical declines elsewhere in Mauritius and are likely to have resulted in the loss of this species from the main island, likely in the mid-19th century.","Historically, the bolyerid snakes underwent a rapid decline, because of human visitation and occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to widespread habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species. Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss.

The species appears to have preferred swamps and swamp forests, such as river valleys, river deltas, and bogs, but it probably also lived in drier forests, and perhaps in open parkland (The Extinction Website, 2007). In Europe, there might have been an ecological separation between the preferred habitat of the aurochs and that of the European bison (<em>Bison bonasus</em>), with the aurochs lived in somewhat wetter forests and the European bison in the somewhat drier forests (The Extinction Website, 2007), though the niches of these two species almost certainly overlapped (Van Vuure, 2003).","This species was extirpated from the majority of its range by the 15th century and persisted only in the Jaktorowka Forest, Masovia, Poland, with the last wild individual reputed to have died in 1627.","In central Poland in the forests of the village of Jaktorów for several centuries the managed of the remaining aurochs was well organised (The Extinction Website, 2007). Initially the animals were owned by nobility, but later they became royal possessions (The Extinction Website, 2007). There they were protected and fed during the winter period (The Extinction Website, 2007). However, the Kings Zygmunt I and his successor Zygmunt August had less interest than their predecessors and did little to preserve the animals, and the conservation measures weakened (The Extinction Website, 2007). After 1572, a period of political turmoil lead to a decrease in influence of the King. By 1604 only a few aurochs remained, and a Royal decree was issued stating that everything needed to be done to protect the aurochs and its habitat, but this was not enough (Van Vuure, 2003). The species disappeared because of hunting and competition on its feeding grounds with domesticated cattle (The Extinction Website, 2007). The last aurochs in Poland disappeared through a combination of lack of interest, corruption, cattle diseases, food competition (from domesticated cattle), and to a lesser extent, hunting (Van Vuure, 2003).",,900000,,,,

By the late 1800s, when the geckos were scarce or had already possibly become restricted to the islets, much of the forests had gone (Cheke and Hume 2008). It is therefore likely that habitat loss was a contributory factor, although when recorded in abundance on Ile aux Foux in the late 1700s, there was virtually no vegetation and the geckos would take refuge in rock crevices (Vinson and Vinson 1969).",Lived in palm trees,Habitat loss,Phelsuma edwardnewtoni,"This diurnal species was brightly coloured, as summarized from historical accounts by Vinson and Vinson (1969): in life, the dorsal colour was bright green with multiple bright blue spots, having a yellow ventral surface and deeper yellow throat, light brown markings around the eyes of preserved specimens may have been red in life (Vinson and Vinson 1969). Historical accounts describe how they could rapidly change colour from the vibrant green to black (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The geckos were reported to measure 20 to 27 cm in total length (Vinson and Vinson 1969), with museum specimens ranging in size from 155 to 207 mm in total length, with snout to vent lengths of 85 to 108 mm (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). The tooth morphology suggests that the species was primarily frugivorous (N. Arnold pers. obs. in Austin <em>et al. </em>2014). Historical accounts state that they consumed the fruit of palm trees, flies and other insects and had a liking for palms, but would venture into buildings, onto roofs and were very tame (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin <em>et al. </em>2014, Cheke and Hume 2008). Natural predators that were recorded by early visitors to Rodrigues consisted of the now extinct Rodrigues Night Heron (<em>Nycticorax megacephalus</em>) and Rodrigues Owl (<em>Mascarenotus murivorus</em>)&#160;(Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).","Listed as Extinct on the basis that this species has not been recorded since the early 20th century despite recent intensive surveys and, as a once-conspicuous species that had already become rare by the late 19th century, there is no reasonable doubt that this species is now extinct.","This gecko species is likely to have become extinct as a result of predation by introduced rats that were present on the main island by the late 1600s, and possibly cats introduced between 1725 and 1761 to control rat populations (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).

The dorsal colour was greyish, with a marbled pattern finely spotted with black, the tail was darker grey without marbling, but with black spots that joined to form longitudinal lines, it had a pale yellow underside and pink tongue (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008). It is reported to have a liking for Latan palms and on Ile Frégate would hide in rock crevices during the day and emerge at sunset to feed (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The gecko was nocturnal and is reported to have been frugivorous, insectivorous and to have predated upon land bird and seabird eggs and chicks (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin <em>et al.</em> 2004, Cheke and Hume 2008).
