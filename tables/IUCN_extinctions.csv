It was presumed extinct until another Pitcairn resident re-discovered a flowering specimen in the native forest in 2003. Despite conservation efforts, the last wild surviving plant died in a landslide in 2005, making the plant Extinct in the Wild. <em>Ex situ</em> conservation efforts to grow and reintroduce the species into its natural habitat, were carried out on Pitcairn island and one <em>ex situ</em> conservation site remains on island. The native vegetation of Pitcairn still needs to be restored and invasive species need to be removed and controlled. This species is assessed as Extinct in the Wild.</p>","<p>This species is a spreading shrub, growing up to 1 metre, with nodding bell-shaped yellow flowers. Flowering time in the wild occurred between July and August. It was known from unstable slopes in the native forest (Smyth 2008, Smyth <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>","<p>There are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining forest, where this species was found. The native species in the forest are being out competed by the non-native, introduced species <em>Syzygium jambos</em> L. (Alston) and other invasive species such as <em>Lantana camara</em> L. (Smyth <em>et al.</em> 2010). <em>Syzygium jambos</em> L. (Alston) locally known as roseapple, was originally brought to the island for fuel wood. However, because of its aggressive growth and the decline of it being harvested for fuel, the plants have become very large trees. Their branches spread laterally, forming a dense canopy and stopping native species from regenerating. Adding to this pressure, heavy soil erosion is also degrading this species’ habitat (Smyth 2008).</p>",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"This species has always been recorded as rare on Pitcairn Island. When it was re-discovered in 2003 only one individual was observed. No wild individuals survived from the 2005 landslide (Smyth <em>et al.</em> 2010).

Pitcairn is a small island, around 4 km in diameter, located in the South Central Pacific Ocean. Together with the islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno it forms part of the Pitcairn Island Group, a UK Overseas Territory. This species was initially collected on Pitcairn by Miss Rosalind Young in 1898 from Palver Valley Ridge but only described as a new species in 1981 by Fosberg. It was seen in the wild in 1955 by I.T. Twyford and collected by H. St. John in 1934. However, it was not found during the flora and vegetation survey of 1997, despite searches of known locations (Kingston 2001). It was re-discovered in 2003 at Tesdide by local islander Carol Warren. Cuttings and seeds were collected and propagated from this rediscovery and replanted at this location. In January 2005, a landslide on the island destroyed the original Tedside plant and three planted seedlings at this location. Despite efforts, this species has not been relocated in the wild ever since (Smyth <em>et al.</em> 2010). It survives in conservation collections <em>ex situ</em>.</p>",There are no known uses for this species.,Terrestrial,"Protecting native plants and their habitats has been recognized as a priority for the Pitcairn Islands by its local government. In 2003 a nursery was established on the island. Native species have been propagated on the island, where a small <em>ex situ</em> collection of this species remains. Cuttings were also brought to National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin and Trinity College Dublin in Ireland and later to England to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew's Tropical Nursery. These plants have flowered and set seed. The 2010 seeds harvested from the National Botanic Gardens Glasnevin were banked at Glasnevin, at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank and also sent to the native species nursery on Pitcairn Island. Species recovery research has been partly funded by the Mohammed Bin Zayed Conservation Fund. Genetic studies were performed on several samples from wild and clone origin. It was proved that the degree of polymorphism in the population was reduced when the original plant and planted seedlings were destroyed in the 2005 landslide. The genetic variation of the <em>ex situ</em> collections is thought to be reduced with only one clone in existence comparing to the variation which might once have existed in the original populations.

Since the 1980s there have been several comprehensive surveys for it by island based botanists and naturalists (notably Mr G. McCormack), the current Cook Islands Flora writer (Mr W.R. Sykes of Landcare Research, New Zealand) and other botanists visiting the island (for example Dr(s) W.A. Whistler, P.J. de Lange, R.O. Gardner, T.J. Martin and Mr E.K.

It is only known from a handful of specimens collected between 1899 and 1929. These were all collected from forested habitats though there is conflict as to the exact type of habitat. Cheeseman (1903, p. 205) states “shaded woods near Arorangi” and Wilder (1931, p. 64) states “in semi-dry valleys, back of village of Avarua, altitude 200 to 300 m”). These are the only botanists to have provided any details as to the species likely habitat preferences. However, W.R. Sykes (pers. comm. 2011) is strongly of the opinion that this was a species of open forested habitats. Irrespective, the lowland and slope forests of Rarotonga, and especially those in the vicinity of Avarua and Arorangi are amongst the most heavily modified on the island as a result of deforestation for agriculture, roading, housing and plantation forestry.

It usually inhabits the upper and middle reaches of the river (it may also have entered the upper estuary of the Yangtze River).

Its key spawning reach was between Maoshui and Hejiang, a stretch of 321.7 km (Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).","Historically, this species experienced unsustainable levels of fishing. Furthermore, mesh sizes of fishing nets have been reduced, thereby capturing young sturgeon, especially during the periods when many juveniles concentrate to feed. Fishing effort and intensity has also increased in the past; for example, in the Neijiang reach of the Tuo River there were only 500 fishing boats in the1950s, but this increased to approximately 2,000 by 1985. In the Leshan Reach of the Ming River, drift gill nets are crowded together from day to night.<br/> <br/> The primary traditional fishing season in the main stream of the Yangzte River was between March and August, with more than 30% of the catch processed between April and May.

The construction of the Xiangjiaba Dam in 2008 is situated in the middle of this sturgeon's spawning reach and is therefore expected to adversely affect it through habitat fragmentation and associated habitat degradation. More recently, two more dams were constructed upriver, changing the temperature and hydrology of the river.<br/> <br/> Additionally, pollution from human development affects the entire Yangtze basin.

Artificial propagation began in 1976 by the Chongqing Fisheries Institute, China (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation, which has not yet been proven successful.

This, and the imminent total ban of fishing, will hopefully improve the chances of this species recovering in the future.",,,,,,,China,,,,,No,No,,"This species is endemic to China, where it is restricted to the Yangtze River system. Historically, under the natural, unaltered conditions that existed until the middle of the 20th century, this species inhabited the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and its large tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, Jialing, Xiang and Han rivers, as well as the large lakes attached to the Yangtze River.<br/> <br/> <em>Acipenser dabryanus</em> had been extirpated from the lower river, possibly since 1995, and it was restricted to the upper main stream of the Yangtze River in the Sichuan Province (Zhuang <em>et al</em>. 1997). Starting in 2007, the conservation release programme was carried out in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, this fish can be found in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in the confluences with some tributaries. However, the majority of individuals observed in the river originate from large scale releases and reproduction of the species in the wild has not been confirmed for at least two decades (one generation length for this species is 30 years).","<em>Acipenser dabryanus</em> was caught intensively for human consumption until the  year 2000. Since 2000, sturgeons are only taken accidentally as  bycatch and were mostly released, however post-release survival was  low. Since 2021, a full ban of fishing (for all fish species) in the  Yangtze River main stem is in place to protect the endemic fish fauna. <br/><br/>There is a large production of this species in aquaculture for restocking and conservation purposes.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing will be banned completely by 2021 in the main stem of the Yangtze River. In 2000, the first national nature reserve was created in the upper Yangzte River. The area of this reserve was extended in 2005 to mitigate the conflict between hydroelectric projects and maintenance of ecosystem functionality. The reserve is now the largest aquatic reserve in China, which has a total length of 1,162.6 km, including 436.5 km of the main river (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/><em>Acipenser dabryanus</em> has been listed as a First Class Protected Animal of the State since 1988, and has received the same effective protection as the Chinese Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser sinensis</em>). This species was also listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998. There is also a national action plan for the species.<br/> <br/> It is considered that the survival of Yangtze Sturgeon entirely relies on stocking efforts, without which this species would possibly become extinct (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2009).

The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. <em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a <em>Nasturtium</em>-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, <em>Moxostoma mascotae</em> (now: <em>Moxostoma austrinum</em>), a Goodeid, <em>Allodontichthys</em> n. sp. (now: <em>Allodontichthys polylepis</em>) and a Poeciliid, <em>Poeciliopsis infans</em>. <em>Rana</em> sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). <br/><br/>Schindler reported to Hieronimus  (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (<em>Xiphophorus hellerii</em>) occurred<em>,</em>&#160;which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei </em>decreased in <em></em>abundance.<em> </em>The Swordtail<em> </em>is thought to have displaced&#160;<em>Allotoca goslinei</em>&#160;through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009 unpublished data).

Soil erosion and extensive loss of habitat as a result of introduced herbivores have been blamed for the extinction of this snake. Introduced mammalian predators, principally rats, have been identified as the leading cause of historical declines elsewhere in Mauritius and are likely to have resulted in the loss of this species from the main island, likely in the mid-19th century.","Not much is known about this snake's ecology, but its morphology with a blunt snout and no neck suggests it was a sub-fossorial species (Vinson 1953, 1975). A snake suspected of being a burrowing boa was reported to quickly burrow into holes in the ground (Vinson 1953). Bullock (1977) reported that the individual caught in 1975 burrowed through loose soil and plant material with ease.&#160; It is thought that the boa would have lived primarily in the understorey of hardwood and palm-rich forests (Vinson 1953, Bullock 1977). Its specialized jaw morphology is similar to that of the keel-scaled boa (Frazzetta 1970, Cundall and Irish 1986, 1989) and suggests that it predated terrestrial lizards and ground nesting/burrowing seabird chicks, but maybe also lizard and bird eggs. Dissection of a female specimen at the Zoological Museum, Hamburg showed it to contain five eggs (Hallermann and Glaw 2006).<br/><br/>An individual collected in 1935 measured 85 cm in length; individuals caught in 1953 and 1967 both measured 95 cm in length (Vinson 1975) and the last individual caught in 1975 was 88 cm in length (Bullock 1977). The five museum specimens measure between 54 and 140 cm (Bauer and Günther 2004). Other specimens have been reported to be up to 180 cm in length (Vinson 1949). The dorsal colouration was light brown with small blackish spots, becoming larger and joining towards the posterior of the body, with vertical streaks on the side of the tail and the ventral colour of the snake was pinkish and marbled and tinged with black (Vinson 1975).","Historically, the bolyerid snakes underwent a rapid decline, because of human visitation and occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to widespread habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species. Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss. Snakes that were encountered on the islands were also shot by early visitors (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Once restricted to Round Island, introduced goats and rabbits denuded the island of much its vegetation and caused extensive loss of soil, thus removing the burrowing boas’ habitat and their likely reptile prey resources. It is also likely that habitat loss would have led to increased predation of juvenile burrowing boas by the endemic Telfair’s Skink <em>Leiolopisma telfairii</em>.",Yes,Yes,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"By 1881, the bolyerid snakes were restricted to Round Island, with rats having invaded Gunner’s Quoin (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) and Flat Island (<em>R. rattus</em>) (Cheke and Hume 2008). By the 1900s, the burrowing boa was extremely rare on Round Island with single encounters in 1935, 1953 and 1967, despite repeated searches between the latter two dates (Vinson 1975). The fourth and last individual was detected in August 1975 (Bullock 1977). The removal of goats (<em>Capra aegagrus hircus</em>) in 1979 and rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) in 1986 (Merton 1987), followed by the recovery and restoration of the island’s habitat occurred too late for the burrowing boa: despite extensive searches and a full time presence of conservation staff on Round Island since 2002, the snake has not been detected (Cole<em> et al.</em> 2018) and is considered to be extinct.",,,Indian Ocean,Mascarenes,No,1634,Mauritius,1638,No,53663,,Yes,Yes,,"The Round Island Burrowing Boa was a Mauritian endemic known from Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>).&#160;The burrowing boa was thought to have occurred on mainland Mauritius, but it is uncertain whether sub-fossil vertebrae belong to this burrowing boa or the extant Keel-scaled Boa <em>Casarea dussumieri </em>(Arnold 1980). If the former, the species is likely to have become locally extinct on this island in the mid-1800s due to the invasion of introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and<em> R. rattus</em>). Snakes of the size of the Round Island Burrowing Boa and Keel-scaled Boa were recorded on the offshore islets Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km2) and Flat Island (2.53 km<sup>2</sup>) in the north until at least 1839 and Ile de la Passe (0.02 km2) in the southeast in the 1760s (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008).

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone<em> </em>2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996).

Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green <em>et al</em>. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of&#160;small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Bd</em>) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to <em>Bd</em>, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% <em>Bd</em> positive rates in tested toads (Polasik<em> et al.</em> 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik <em>et al.</em> 2015).",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter<em> et al</em>. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and&#160;reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002,&#160;2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015).

It is omnivorous, but primarily feeds on the fruit of native understory plants (Maxfield 1998, USFWS and Hawai'i DLNR 1999)<strong></strong>. As well as fruits and berries, the species feeds on eggs, young birds, insects and carrion (Faike 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Captive-reared birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food (Faike 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Nest construction usually begins in March and the first clutches are laid in April (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","It has suffered from extensive habitat alteration, particularly reduction of understory food-plants as a result of the activities of feral ungulates, logging, agriculture and the loss of pollinators and dispersers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Problematic ungulates include feral cattle, mouflon sheep, feral sheep and goats (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The impact of shooting has probably been substantial, even in recent decades. In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006)<strong></strong>. The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>and<em> </em>the native Hawaiian Hawk <em>Buteo solitarius </em>(classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) <strong></strong>and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> carried by feral cats (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2002, J.

The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009).

About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders  (Switzer 2011).

The species appears to have preferred swamps and swamp forests, such as river valleys, river deltas, and bogs, but it probably also lived in drier forests, and perhaps in open parkland (The Extinction Website, 2007). In Europe, there might have been an ecological separation between the preferred habitat of the aurochs and that of the European bison (<em>Bison bonasus</em>), with the aurochs lived in somewhat wetter forests and the European bison in the somewhat drier forests (The Extinction Website, 2007), though the niches of these two species almost certainly overlapped (Van Vuure, 2003).","In central Poland in the forests of the village of Jaktorów for several centuries the managed of the remaining aurochs was well organised (The Extinction Website, 2007). Initially the animals were owned by nobility, but later they became royal possessions (The Extinction Website, 2007). There they were protected and fed during the winter period (The Extinction Website, 2007). However, the Kings Zygmunt I and his successor Zygmunt August had less interest than their predecessors and did little to preserve the animals, and the conservation measures weakened (The Extinction Website, 2007). After 1572, a period of political turmoil lead to a decrease in influence of the King. By 1604 only a few aurochs remained, and a Royal decree was issued stating that everything needed to be done to protect the aurochs and its habitat, but this was not enough (Van Vuure, 2003). The species disappeared because of hunting and competition on its feeding grounds with domesticated cattle (The Extinction Website, 2007). The last aurochs in Poland disappeared through a combination of lack of interest, corruption, cattle diseases, food competition (from domesticated cattle), and to a lesser extent, hunting (Van Vuure, 2003).",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted to nobles and gradually to the royal household (The Extinction Website, 2007). As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased but the royal court still required gamekeepers to provide open fields for the aurochs to graze in (The Extinction Website, 2007). The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service and a decree made poaching an aurochs punishable by death (The Extinction Website, 2007), but this was not enough to save the species. In 1564, the gamekeepers knew of only 38 animals, according to the royal survey (The Extinction Website, 2007).

The wild bird and the <em>P. maracana</em> apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid. <p></p>","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros <em>et. al.</em>&#160;2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record.

However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw <em>Propyrrhura maracana</em>, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female <em>C. spixii</em> was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line<strong></strong> (Caparroz <em>et al. </em>2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female <em>P. maracana</em> in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000).

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em>&#160;series&#160;(McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em> group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct.

The island is a relatively flat shelf of pot-holed, karstic dolomite covered by sparse, shrubby vegetation (largely the result of 19th century mining operations) with a second, higher plateau with apparently natural savannas as well as areas cleared during the mining operations, interspersed with dense but stunted woodland dominated by four tree species: Short Leaf Fig (<em>Ficus populnea </em>var. <em>brevifolia</em>)<em>, </em>False Mastic (<em>Sideroxylon foetidissimum</em>)<em>, </em>Pigeon Plum (<em>Coccoloba diversifolia</em>)<em>, </em>and Poisonwood (<em>Metopium brownei</em>). Although iguanas probably occurred island-wide prior to their extinction, preferred habitat almost certainly consisted of rocky areas and savannas instead of the densely forested portions of the island. Because Navassa lacks beaches, nesting presumably occurred in pockets of mineralized phosphate that accumulated in potholes. The phosphate (which was commercially extracted during the period when the iguanas presumably became extinct) might have been either of marine or terrestrial origin: precipitates of seawater during periods of submergence or from fish digested by birds and deposited as guano, respectively.<br/><br/>Among the five specimens&#160;known for this iguana, the maximum snout-vent length is 42 cm for the largest male and 37.8 cm snout-vent length for the largest female (Powell 2000).

When this species was first discovered in 1957 the population consisted of 25 individuals (Gann 2015). The total population was fewer than 10 plants at the time of the final verified collection and sighting in 1964 (Gann 2015). Hurricane Donna in 1960 altered the conditions in the hammock where <em>G. floridana</em> was located (Luer 1972). This did not appear to initially have any impact on the existing plants, but it may have contributed to their subsequent decline. Removal of plants and trampling of the site by poachers was reported at the time of the final collection and likely constituted a threat to this species (Gann 2015). Attempts to rediscover <em>G. floridana</em> have been made throughout the hammock where it was once found, as well as in other hardwood hammocks on Big Pine Key with similar conditions, by multiple experts for many years (Gann <em>et al</em>. 2009, Gann 2015). While ephemeral in nature, it is large and distinctive both vegetatively and in flower and therefore probably not easily overlooked (Luer 1972, Brown 2000). Thus, having not been seen for 58 years despite these efforts, the available evidence suggests that this species is Extinct.<br/><br/>An Extinct assessment for this taxon is supported by application of the Records and Surveys Model, as outlined by&#160;Thompson<em>&#160;et al</em>. (2017). Applying the Records and Surveys Model gives a probability of extinction of 0.99. For the&#160; Threats Model, given the uncertainties about which threat(s) are responsible for the extinction of this species and how much of the range they affected, the maximum uncertainty was applied which resulted in a probability of extinction of 0.25. This meant that the combined results only gave an average probability of extinction of 0.62. However, the weighted averages result for the probability of extinction ranges from 0,9 to 0.99, hence the maximum probability gives the same result of EX, and is therefore considered to be acceptable. See attached Supplementary Information document for further details.</p>",<p><em>Govenia floridana</em> is a terrestrial orchid that grew in deep hummus on the forest floor of heavily shaded tropical hardwood hammock habitat in Everglades National Park.

In 1960 Hurricane Donna significantly altered conditions in the single hardwood hammock where this species occurred, increasing light penetration to the forest floor and causing an increase in understory vegetation. Altered conditions did not appear to have an immediate impact on the population of <em>Govenia floridana</em>, but may have contributed to its decline (Luer 1972). Long Pine Key, where this orchid was located, is protected within Everglades National Park.

In China there are now fenced populations in Beijing, Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. <br/><br/>The first conservation reintroduction of Père David’s Deer to China included two groups, of 20 deer (5 males : 15 females) and 18 deer (all females), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. All 38 deer were donated by the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey (later the 14th Duke of Bedford), who also covered transportation costs of the first group. After a careful search and evaluation by a group of zoologists, botanists, wildlife managers and officers, the relic site of the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park (39°07'N, 116°03'E), with an area of 60 ha. The deer in the park have received supplemental feeding year round (Jiang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000a).<br/><br/>The second re-introduction of <em>E. davidianus</em> was carried out in August of 1987, organized by former Ministry of Forestry and funded by WWF. A group of 39 Père David’s Deer was selected from five zoological gardens in the United Kingdom, with the deer mainly from the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. An extensive search, which covered a vast area in eastern China for a potential reintroduction site was conducted before a decision was made. The Dafeng State-Owen Forestry Farm was chosen, on the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China in a lightly populated area (semi-fossils of Père David’s Deer have been excavated from the neighbouring counties, so this site is probably in its natural habitat). The introduced herd was released into three fenced paddocks, each about 100 ha in area. The reserve purchased another 30 km² land in 1995, more than doubling its original size. In 1997, the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve was approved by the National Nature Reserve Commission as a national nature reserve. The Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve has the potential to host a large population of Père David’s Deer. The reserve has kept the reintroduced Père David’s Deer and their offspring on its land, and in 1998 the first group of deer was released from the paddocks into the wider reserve (Hu and Jiang 2002). In 2003, and 2006 another two groups of deer were released from the paddocks. There were 950 Père David’s Deer in the reserve in 2006. The annual average population growth rate of deer in the reserve was 17.01%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for further expanding of the DafengMilu Nature Reserve (Jiang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000b). <br/><br/>The Beijing Milu Park is in the southeast suburb of Beijing with a limited area and is now part of a much larger ‘Wetland Park’ being established (2012-2016), whereas the DafengMilu Nature Reserve is located in a remote coastal region with little human settlement, where it is possible to acquire more land for conservation. Therefore, the Beijing Milu Park while keeping a healthy nuclear breeding herd of about 200 deer at the park, is shipping Père David’s Deer to other sites in east China (Yang 2007) and in Hebei Province. The translocations thus reduced the grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expanded the distribution range of the Père David’s Deer in the country. The average annual population growth rate for Père David’s Deer in Beijing Milu Park from 1987-1997 was 17.3%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for an expansion of this artificial dispersal of animals to establish new sites (Jiang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000b). <br/><br/><em>E. davidianus</em> from the Beijing Milu Park have been relocated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in eastern China and Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In October 1993, a group of 30 Père David’s Deer (8 males : 22 females) arrived and was released in a paddock on a small peninsular along the Yangtze River, Shishou (29°49'N,112°33'E). This site was later established as the Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The size of the reserve is 11.67 km². Another group of 34 Père David’s Deer (10 males : 24 females) was transferred from the Beijing Milu Park to the Shishou paddock in the following year to enlarge the population. An additional 30 deer (15 males : 15 females) were released into the paddock of the reserve in 2002. The relocated deer reproduced in the second year after the relocation (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2002). By the end of calving season of 2006, there were 522 <em>E. davidianus</em> in the Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The annual average population growth rate was 22.2%. The birth rate and population growth rate in Shishou were significantly higher whereas the mortality rate was significantly lower than those of the Dafeng Nature Reserve. <br/><br/>In November, 2002, 30 <em>E. davidianus</em> (14 males : 16 females) from Beijing Milu Park and 20 from the DafengMilu Nature Reserve were introduced to Yuanyang Forestry Farm, Henan. These deer are in an enclosure on the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve (35°11'N, 114°15'E). In 2006, there were 53 deer in the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve paddock, but the sex ratio was predominately male biased (38 males : 15 females) (Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). <br/><br/>Currently, there are a total of 53 herds of <em>E. davidianus</em> in China. Nine herds have fewer than 25 deer, 75.5% have fewer than 10 deer (Yang <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Such a small herd size raise question about the effective population size and health of population genetics, since those herds are isolated and there is no gene exchange. The artificially dispersed <em>E. davidianus</em> herds are similar to a meta-population. The viability of the meta-population depends on the man-made gene exchange process by the managers. <br/><br/>There are now four wild populations (not fenced) living in Hubei and Hunan provinces established by escaped individuals from Shishou Nature Reserve during severe flooding in 1998. The latest data from 2015 suggests that the wild population is about 600 individuals (M. Boyd pers. comm. 2015), surveys need to be conducted to assess the long-term viability of these populations.",,,,,,,China,,,,149000,No,No,,"This species is endemic to China. Père David’s Deer has been recovered from the brink of extinction and has become a classic example of how to rescue a highly threatened species (Ebenehard 1995). In the mid 1980s, Père David’s Deer was re-introduced into captive facilities in China, and populations established first in Beijing and then in Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. <br/><br/>Fossils of <em>Elaphurus bifurcatus</em>, <em>E. chinanensis chia</em>, <em>E. lantianensis</em> have been excavated from the region east of Xi’an and south of Harbin. The modern species of <em>Elaphurus</em>, Père David’s Deer (Milu in Chinese) evolved in the Pliocene period of the Tertiary, according to fossils excavated in southern Japan. During the Pleistocene period, it was known from Manchuria (Hofmann 2007). During the Holocene, <em>P. davidianus</em> was restricted to swamps and wetlands in the region south of 43°N and east of 110°E in mainland China (Cao 1993, Zhou 2007). However, the distribution of <em>P. davidianus</em> shrank and its population declined due to hunting and land reclamation in the swamp areas as human population expanded (Jiang and Li 1999). <em>P. davidianus</em> is believed to have been largely extinct in the wild 1500 years before the last head was decimated by the late 19th century during the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing.<br/><br/>During the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden contained a herd of <em>P. davidianus</em> in its 200 km² hunting ground. This hunting garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was predominantly a wetland, consisting of swamps, ponds and lakes crossed by the Yongding River. The area had been sealed off from the outside world since the Yuan Dynasty (1205-1368) as a royal garden. The French missionary Père Armand David “discovered” <em>P. davidianus</em> in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1864. Realizing that the deer was an unknown species to the West, he persuaded the wardens to give him hinds and skeletons of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris in 1866, where the species was named Père David’s deer by Milne-Edwards. In 1895, the surrounding wall of the Nanyuan Hunting Garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the Père David’s Deer escaped and were hunted. Only 20-30 animals survived in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops and the remaining deer were shot and eaten.<br/><br/>However, before the demise of the royal herd of Père David’s Deer in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1900, the deer had been introduced into private deer collections in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany. During the first decade of the 20th century, the 11th Duke of Bedford in the United Kingdom gathered the last 18 Père David’s Deer in the world to form a breeding herd at the Woburn Abbey Estate, England. Only 11 of these deer were capable of reproducing (Bedford, 1951-52).

In particular, declines appear to have taken place in most native lizard species following the introduction of the Indian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>) in the early 1980s (Andrew <em>et al. </em>2016), and Wolf Snake predation is now understood to be the proximate cause of this skink's extinction.

Its closest sister species, <em>Gongylomorphus bojerii</em> from Mauritius, is diurnal and inhabits most habitats on the island (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009), including lowland forest, grassland, sparsely vegetated areas with creepers as ground cover, and bare rock with crevices and rock piles (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2020). The Réunion species was probably found in dry forest in the west of the island and in coastal vegetation (Probst 1998). It was probably primarily insectivorous in common with its extant relatives (Probst 1998)","This species is extinct, and the most likely cause of its extinction is the introduction of the Southeast Asian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>), a specialist feeder on lizards, to Réunion in the mid-19th century (Austin&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). The documented timing of this snake's establishment on both Réunion (by 1840, based on testimony taken in 1839 - Cheke 1987) and mainland Mauritius (before 1873 - Daruty de Grandpré 1883) coincides with the extinction of <em>Gongylomorphus </em>skinks on both islands.&#160;Musk Shews (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), have been observed preying on Mauritian <em>Gongylomorphus</em>&#160;(Cole 2011), and this invasive species probably contributed to the historical decline (M.

A total of 40 specimens were collected from the Horse Point area during the two Belgian expeditions from the Royal Museum for Central Africa in 1965-6 and 1967 (Brindle 1970). Live specimens were not found at any other sites at this time although they reported fragments of dead individuals from the south and east flanks of Flagstaff. There are a couple of unconfirmed records that the species was present after this time and it was thought to be declining. Two expeditions were conducted by Paul Pearce-Kelly from the London Zoo in 1988 and 1993, however, they failed to find any trace of the species. Recent intensive survey work in the 1990s and 2000s by Philip and Myrtle Ashmole failed to locate the species in this or nearby areas (Ashmole and Ashmole 2003). Howard Mendel from the Natural History Museum in London also failed to find it during a visit with the Ashmoles in 2005-6. The habitat at Horse Point has been degraded as far as this species is concerned since the time of the Belgian expeditions by the removal of nearly all surface stones, under which specimens were then found, for construction purposes. There has also been potential increased predator pressure from mice and rats, and probably also from invasive non-native predatory invertebrates including spiders and the centipede <em>Scolopendra morsitans</em>&#160;Linnaeus, 1758. The only possible evidence that this species may have persisted beyond the time of the Belgian expeditions has been the discovery of fragments of dead individuals. A sub-fossil forcep and ninth abdominal tergite was found with bird bones in 1995 near Prosperous Bay. Two further ninth abdominal tergites have been recovered since. The first was found under a discarded piece of equipment in the centre of Horse Point Plain in 2013; the second in a small area at the Millennium Forest in 2014 where some remaining surface rock is present. However, this second fragment was found in a concentration of invertebrate remains in the lair of a predatory spider. As all of these remains are fragmentary and the insect itself relatively robust with remains persisting potentially for many decades it has to be assumed that these specimens had been dead for a considerable time. The species is large, charismatic and of iconic status on the island; while there is still a slim possibility that it may still persist in some remote location, the balance of evidence points towards the species being extinct. The last confirmed adult sighting was in May 1967.","The species is xerophilus and nocturnal. At Horse Point the species was mostly found in burrows beneath stones with the adults appearing during the summer rains (December to February), seeking shelter again at the onset of drier weather (Brindle 1970). The burrows extended for a considerable distance and eventually become lost in fissures in the soil. When disturbed the adults tried to escape by running into these burrows. Mating was observed twice on 22/12/1965 and 1/2/1967 and a females with eggs were observed on 8/3/1967 and 24/3/1967.

Some cultivated specimens have been replanted in semi-wild situations since the 1980s, but little or no recruitment has been observed except at one site.<br/><br/>The species was listed as ‘Critically Endangered C2a(i); D’ by Cairns-Wicks (2003). The transfer of status to ‘Extinct in the Wild’ is the result of the death of the last surviving individuals in the wild.</p>","<p>She Cabbage is a small tree, though it may reach 9 m in height under favourable conditions. Young plants produce very large leaves directly from the main stem, and typically grow extremely quickly; they are capable of reaching 2 m in little over a year. Growth slows at maturity and the tree becomes more branched with much smaller leaves. However, the life cycle is often very short, and many individuals start to display signs of senescence within a decade. Death usually occurs within 20 years.<br/><br/>This ephemeral phenology is characteristic of a ‘forest gap colonizer’, and it seems likely that the She Cabbage behaved<em> </em>as one: exploiting short-lived forest clearings, maturing and reproducing before becoming outcompeted by stronger species. Aside from conjecture however, there is no surviving description of the original habitat. Several tree species might have occurred in the mid-altitude belt, but the composition of the woodland around which the ‘gaps’ formed have not been determined.<br/><br/>Plants flower sporadically throughout much of the year but more so in the winter months. There is considerable variation in seed viability between individuals which suggests a degree of self-incompatibility, although the mechanism behind this is unknown. The achenes possess a pappus and are dispersed by the wind, but at some sites the majority are consumed by introduced bird species.<br/><br/>The unusually soft wood is prone to rapid decay and is host to several species of endemic wood-boring invertebrates. This xylophagous fauna is still poorly-known and its degree of overlap with other hosts is unclear. At least five species of beetle (Coloptera: Curculionidae/Anthribidae) and one moth (Tineidae: <em>Opogona</em> sp.) were present on the Osbourne’s trees and the impact of the loss on this potentially highly endangered micro-fauna is a major concern.</p>","<p>Deforestation was almost certainly the major cause of widespread decline in the She Cabbage. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the native woodlands were felled for timber and fuel. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. The soft wood was probably not a major target for felling, but it would have undoubtedly been useful for stoking fires and strong timbers were occasionally used for joists.<br/><br/>Deprived of new colonization opportunities, short-lived gap species may be particularly vulnerable to extinction once reduced to small, isolated patches. Indeed, it is unlikely that She Cabbage could persist in the wild on St Helena today without extensive restoration of large tracks of forest to create a viable network of temporary glades. The problems of fragmentation have been further compounded by partial self-incompatibility.<br/><br/>The last natural locality at Osbourne’s has not provided particularly suitable habitat for this species since it was discovered. Surrounded on all sides by pasture, plants suffered considerable wind damage due to the lack of a surrounding canopy to shield them. Furthermore, without heavy shade, the understorey had a tendency to become densely in-filled with non-native grasses, which effectively prevented the light wind-blown seed from coming into contact with the ground.</p>",No,No,5 Specific description,"<p>From the 20<sup>th</sup> Century onwards, very few wild locations have been known.&#160;In the 1950s&#160;Norman Kerr encountered six individuals in Grape Vine Gut, but when these subsequently died the species was assumed to be extinct. In 1976, George Benjamin discovered a group of three mature trees along a hedge in pasture land near Osbourne’s Spring. With careful management, this colony increased to 35 individuals by 1995, and another site was discovered at Cole’s Rock (Cairns-Wicks, 2003). However, the latter was lost by the late 1990s, and the subpopulation at Osbourne’s dwindled alarmingly: to 7 individuals by 2003, 5 by 2007 and 2 by 2010. The last two survivors succumbed to gales in 2012.<br/><br/>A cultivated population has been established from seed collected at Osbourne’s, and there are currently several locations across St Helena where small stands have been planted. The most important are at Mount Pleasant, High Peak Cottage, Cason’s, Osbourne’s and Napoleon’s Tomb. Collectively, these sites contain close to 1,000 individuals.</p>",,,St Helena,St Helena,No,1658,St Helena,,,,,Yes,Yes,,"The She Cabbage Tree is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but survives in cultivation in several places on the island.&#160;This distinctive tree appears to have been locally common until the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Roxburgh noted that “in the forests which decorate the south face of Sandy-bay ridge, it grows plentifully” (see Beatson 1816) and Burchell recorded it on the “road from Plantation House to Longwood in moist glens” (see Cronk 2002). This suggests a reasonably broad distribution in sheltered locations across St Helena’s upper mid-altitude zone, perhaps from 600 m to 750 m. As the remaining suitable habitat fragments were lost through progressive deforestation, the few surviving trees became increasingly confined to isolated localities near the species’ upper natural altitudinal limits, often where the range encroached the edges of preserved cloud forest vegetation. However, there is little evidence that this distinctive tree was a regular part of the cloud forest community, and recent plantings on Diana’s Peak Ridge and the windward face of High Peak have not fared particularly well.",Formerly used in building (roofing timbers of old houses like Mount Pleasant).,Terrestrial,"<p>Following agreement on a species action plan (Cairns-Wicks 2007), recovery work has now been sustained for several years. The efforts arrived just in time to avoid total extinction despite the demise of the wild population. Seed collected from Osbourne’s was sourced from several parents and there is no indication of acute inbreeding depression. However, considerable effort is required to maintain seed stocks because the large achenes do not tolerate long-term storage by standard methods and must be sown fresh. In addition, ripe achenes are produced only sporadically and must be collected very quickly before they are dispersed or predated. The fertility of a given plant probably depends on genetic factors relating to the individual and also to the spatial arrangement of potential nearby pollen donors. A number of ‘good seeders’ have emerged amongst the current parental generation, and the resultant increase in productivity has enabled several hundred daughter individuals to be propagated since 2012.<br/><br/>The original offspring from Osbourne’s and Grape Vine Gut provenances were planted widely and in small numbers around St Helena’s Central Ridge, but most of these specimens have now died. Such small, dispersed groupings proved to be difficult to tend and less likely to have high fertility. More recent efforts have therefore focused on planting in fewer but larger concentrations. Despite the reasonably healthy state of the recovery programme, the very short generation time of this species ensures that it is still in a very precarious state. The current cohort may not survive much more than a decade, and the risk of extinction remains high unless intensive collection and propagation work is continued.<br/><br/>Most of the recently-established She Cabbage plantations are functional seed orchards, designed for convenience. However, the oldest is a private restoration initiative in a semi-natural setting at Mt Pleasant. Here a thriving population has been created amongst mixed stands of endemics, with a graded-age structure. In this favourable habitat, plants naturally self-seed to a moderate degree despite patchy levels of viability, although none of the progeny has yet reached maturity (R.

After Stuenes' work (1989), the most complete account is that by Rakotovao <em>et al.</em> (2014), who notably documented significant intraspecific variations within both species. The origin of these species remains uncertain: they are generally seen as deriving from continental species of <em>Hippopotamus</em>, maybe from <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>. A third extinct Madagascan species, <em>Hippopotamus laloumena</em>, was proposed by Faure and Guérin (1990) on limited evidence. A recent publication by Faure<em> et al.</em> (2010) does not add significant evidence in favor of the validity of this species, and its dissimilarity from <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em> still needs to be clarified (Weston and Lister 2009).

Gommery <em>et al.</em> (2011) proposed an earlier evidence of hippopotamid butchery at least dated to 1400 BC.

After Stuenes’ work (1989), the most complete account is that by Rakotovao <em>et al.</em> (2014), who notably documented significant intraspecific variations within both species. The origin of these species remains uncertain: they are generally seen as deriving from continental species of <em>Hippopotamus</em>, maybe from the extant <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>. A third extinct Madagascan species, <em>Hippopotamus laloumena</em>, was proposed by Faure and Guérin (1990) on limited evidence. A recent publication by Faure <em>et al.</em> (2010) does not add significant evidence in favor of the validity of this species, and&#160; its dissimilarity from <em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em> needs to be clarified.

Turvey <em>et al.</em> (2006) assessed whether hunting alone would have been sufficient to wipe out the sea cow, and showed that the speed of sea cow disappearance on Bering Island indicates that hunting alone was more than sufficient to exterminate the species without having to invoke any additional ecological pressures.&#160;Conversely, Estes <em>et al.</em> (2015) argued that hunting of sea otters alone could account for the sea cows’ extinction.

Tindale (1933) recorded the burning of the Stick-nest Rats’ nest and the capture of the fleeing inhabitants on his ‘Mann Ranges 1933’ black-and-white film (copies held by the South Australian Museum and by the University of Adelaide). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including one from 1970, and occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, but there seems little doubt that the species is Extinct.","<p>Stick-nest Rats constructed large nests of sticks and sometimes stones, depending on available construction materials. Some remaining in caves in breakaways in the Gibson Desert and near the Finke stock route in the southern Northern Territory are more than 3 m by 2 m by 1 m high. Stick nests were also built in wooded country well away from ranges, but most have not survived (Burbidge and Fuller 1979, Copley 1999, see Tindale 1933 for black and white film when the last two specimens were collected). The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of&#160; the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat <em>L. conditor</em> are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. A nest may have sheltered several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest.<br/><br/>Radiocarbon dates of Stick-nest Rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson <em>et al</em>. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.</p>","Predation by feral cats is considered the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonized the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes in range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.",Yes,Yes,5 Specific description,"<p>Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria).

However, by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988).

This species experienced very rapid declines, from being relatively common to extinct at each known locality within just a year or so, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This species was a rainforest specialist, endemic to the Wet Tropics Bioregion (Williams and Hero 1998, 2001), and found in upland rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest along fast-flowing streams where there is white water from riffles and cascades (Liem 1974, McDonald 1992). It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger <em>et al. </em>1999).<br/><br/>Richard <em>et al.</em> (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).

The population was extremely small for at least 120 years before the final tree died in 1994. Well under 1 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat remains along St Helena’s Central Ridge and this has been searched extensively by botanists over recent decades.,"<p>Based on existing evidence, it appears that this species was an inhabitant of cloud forest around St Helena’s highest altitudes (above 750 m). The 20<sup>th</sup> Century specimen at Mt Actaeon grew in Tree Fern thicket (Cronk 2002), but it is also likely to have occurred in more mixed vegetation with other upland trees on steep slopes below the ridge crest. As the high altitude zone comprises the last vestiges of native forest on St Helena, there remains a possibility that the final individuals were relicts along the upper altitudinal edge of the former range and that the natural distribution would have extended to lower altitudes. However, the Olive certainly seemed to be a regular cloud forest species and a more natural member of this community than other postulated ‘transitional zone’ trees such as Redwood (<em>Trochetiopsis erythroxylon</em> (G.Forst.) Marais) and She Cabbage (<em>Lachanodes arborea</em> (Roxb.) B.Nord.).<br/><br/>The flowering period was variable but was probably mainly restricted to the winter months. The small blooms were mainly pollinated by hoverflies, and matured into dry capsules which took up to a year to ripen (Jackson 1991).</p>","<p>The majority of the population was probably lost to deforestation following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1658. Trees were cleared for pasture land and also to provide fuel and timber, for which the hard, yellow wood was probably reasonably prized. Only fragments of the original mid-altitude forest cover remained by the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century, and by the time of Melliss’s records in the late 1800s there was little native vegetation away from the highest elevations. Further extensive damage was inflicted in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century when large plantations of New Zealand flax (<em>Phormium tenax</em> J.R.Forst. &amp; G.Forst.) were established over the steep slopes of the Central Ridge, although it appears that the species was already close to extinction by this time.<br/><br/>Once severely reduced in numbers, small population size appears to have created further, inherent problems through low self-compatibility and perhaps also through inbreeding depression which may have reduced resilience to pests.

Unfortunately, the sprinkler system was not ready by the time the water was cut off in 2000, and by the time the sprinklers came on nine months later the ecosystem had already dried up (see Krajick 2006). Later, during the dry season in 2003, the artificial sprinkler system failed for a while. Around this time, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was confirmed in dead animals of this species, and this disease is probably responsible for the final population crash. It is possible that the drought caused by the failure of the sprinkler system resulted in stress to the animals that rendered them susceptible to the disease. There are also reports that the 2003 crash coincided with a brief opening of the dam's floodgates to flush sediments; tests showed that these contained pesticides used in maize farming operations upstream, in concentrations sufficient to kill the toads (Krajick 2006).

Their diet is unknown, but may have included eels, lobsters, octopus, and reef fish. Like other true seals, the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land, and its lack of fear of humans and an unaggressive and curious nature contributed to its demise. They were medium-sized seals, with adult standard lengths of 200-240 cm (Allen 2004). Very little is known about the natural history of&#160; the Caribbean Monk Seal, but related species mature at 4-8 years old, give birth to a single pup (usually annually), and can live to be more than 20 years old.","The only known predators of Caribbean Monk Seals were sharks and humans. Intensive exploitation began with the voyages of Columbus, and continued for centuries afterwards, as the seals were killed for their skins and oil. In more recent years, the seal was also subject to persecution from the fishing industry. This human pressure brought the population to very low numbers, ultimately resulting in extinction of the species (Allen 2004, Hairr 2011).",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"Caribbean Monk Seals were first discovered by Columbus in 1494, and early records testify to its abundance in several parts of the Caribbean. Population size prior to exploitation has been estimated as 233,000-338,000 (McClenachan and Cooper 2007). Hunting of Caribbean Monk Seals by Europeans for food began with Columbus, and many animals were killed for that reason over the following centuries. In the late 1600s hundreds of seals were killed primarily to be used for oil to lubricate machinery on sugar plantations. Additional animals were taken for public display and killed for museum specimens and other reasons (Hairr 2011). By the late 1880s the species was rare, though the Triangle Keys west of Yucatan remained a stronghold of the species until 1915 when about 200 animals were killed there (<a href=""http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/"">The Sixth Extinction Website</a> 2007). The last reliable record from anywhere was of a small colony at Seranilla Bank, a group of tiny coral islands halfway between Jamaica and Honduras, in 1952 (Adams 2004). An aerial survey in 1973 covering much of the species known range did not produce any seal sightings (Kenyon 1977). Vessel surveys of the region in 1980 (Sergeant et al. 1980) and 1984 (LeBoeuf et al. 1986) also&#160; failed to locate any seals. Unconfirmed sightings of Caribbean Monk Seals by local fishermen and divers (see for example Boyd and Stanfield (1998)) almost certainly refer to wandering Hooded Seals that have been positively identified on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2001).",,,,,,,Carribbean Sea,,,,200000,No,Yes,,"The Caribbean Monk Seal inhabited primarily the Caribbean Sea, northwest to the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

(2007) suggested that the population may have reached 1 million when Scimitar-horned Oryx range was at its maximum, during the early Holocene (9500–4500 BP). Until the mid-20th century the species seems to have remained common in the Sahel, where herds of several hundred, and sometimes several thousand, were recorded, notably in Chad and Niger (Newby 1988). A herd of 10,000 was recorded in Chad in 1936 according to Bassett (1975). In the 1950s and early 1960s, herds of 100 or more were regularly reported in Chad and Niger but only small populations farther west, and a very few in eastern Chad and further east (Gillet 1969, Newby 1988, Dragesco-Joffé 1993). By the end of the 1970s the world population was estimated at 6,000 individuals (Newby 1988). Oryx were estimated to number 4,000–6,000 in the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim region in 1975-1978, following rigorous anti-poaching and several good rainy seasons but then were reduced following the interruption of protection (Thomassey and Newby 1990). At the beginning of the 1980s, there were &lt;200 in Niger (Grettenberger and Newby 1990) and perhaps a few small groups elsewhere, for example in Mali (Heringa 1990). The last herds in Chad disappeared in the late 1980s-early 1990s. <br/><br/>There are captive populations in fenced protected areas in several former range states: in Tunisia, there were ca. 100 in Dghoumes N.P. in 2014 (Cooke <em>et al.</em> in press), ca. 50 in Oued Dekouk N.P. (2014)&#160;and ca. 40 in both Bou Hedma N.P. (2012) and Sidi-Toui N.P.

These populations are all maintained in fenced enclosures of varying sizes and are subject to different degrees of management. None is eligible for consideration as a reintroduced population for Red List assessment purposes. In Chad, 25 animals were transferred to Oudi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in March 2016 and are due to be released into the reserve in August 2016.

It is now Extinct in the Wild. In Algeria they were found in the south and vagrants likely occurred north of the Sahara (De Smet and Smith 2001). In Egypt, the historical range included most of the Western Desert, west of the River Nile, but mostly in oases and wadis (Morrow <em>et al. </em>2013). In Libya the species was described in regions close to known populations in N Chad and the Western Desert of Egypt. There are no confirmed records of Scimitar-horned Oryx from Libya. The species formerly occurred in Western Sahara (Aulagnier <em>et al.</em> 2001). Oryx may have occurred at least sporadically in S Tunisia, but some doubted that an established population existed and none were able to provide first-hand information or reliably sourced specimens (Morrow <em>et al. </em>2013 and references therein). Oryx formerly inhabited only extreme NE Nigeria, possibly only as a seasonal migrant (East 1999).<br/><br/>The species has been released into fenced enclosures in four protected areas in Tunisia and one in Senegal as part of long-term reintroduction programmes, though none of these is yet considered a full 'reintroduction onto the wild'.

Most of the animals in the ISB and in Texas are thought to be descended from 40-50 founders, originating in Chad, so it is likely that the proportion of genetic diversity represented is low.<br/><br/>As part of planned reintroduction projects, animals have been released into fenced protected areas in Tunisia (Bou Hedma N.P. 1985, Sidi Toui N.P. 1999, Oued Dekouk N.P. 1999, Dghoumes N.P. 2007), Morocco (Souss-Massa N.P. 1995), and Senegal (Ferlo F.R 1998, Guembeul W.R. 1999).

Historical accounts describe how they could rapidly change colour from the vibrant green to black (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The geckos were reported to measure 20 to 27 cm in total length (Vinson and Vinson 1969), with museum specimens ranging in size from 155 to 207 mm in total length, with snout to vent lengths of 85 to 108 mm (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). The tooth morphology suggests that the species was primarily frugivorous (N. Arnold pers. obs. in Austin <em>et al. </em>2014). Historical accounts state that they consumed the fruit of palm trees, flies and other insects and had a liking for palms, but would venture into buildings, onto roofs and were very tame (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin <em>et al. </em>2014, Cheke and Hume 2008). Natural predators that were recorded by early visitors to Rodrigues consisted of the now extinct Rodrigues Night Heron (<em>Nycticorax megacephalus</em>) and Rodrigues Owl (<em>Mascarenotus murivorus</em>)&#160;(Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).","This gecko species is likely to have become extinct as a result of predation by introduced rats that were present on the main island by the late 1600s, and possibly cats introduced between 1725 and 1761 to control rat populations (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008). By the late 1800s, when the geckos were scarce or had already possibly become restricted to the islets, much of the forests had gone (Cheke and Hume 2008). It is therefore likely that habitat loss was a contributory factor, although when recorded in abundance on Ile aux Foux in the late 1700s, there was virtually no vegetation and the geckos would take refuge in rock crevices (Vinson and Vinson 1969).",Yes,Yes,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"This species is extinct. Only seven preserved specimens are known, six of which are in museums (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2014), in addition to numerous sub-fossil bones from approximately 100 individuals (Austin <em>et al</em>. 2004). The species survived for longer than other endemic lizards on Rodrigues, none of which are extant. Until 1795, it was still abundant on the main island and was probably found on several of the 21 offshore islets, but the only islet from which it was confirmed as being present is Ile aux Fous (0.33 ha), where it was recorded in great numbers by Pingré in 1761 (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the late 1700s, Philibert Marragon observed that fewer geckos were encountered in winter compared to summer (Vinson and Vinson 1969). In 1874, they could not be found on the mainland and two specimens collected in 1884 were thought to have been from one of the islets (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The last two geckos - collected by Etienne Thirioux in 1917 - were also thought to have been from an islet (Vinson and Vinson 1969).

There has been extensive survey work for, and monitoring of, this species over recent decades which has documented a dramatic population decline from previously being common and widespread across Christmas Island. It was listed as Critically Endangered in 2006 after a decline in excess of 90% in three generations (12–15 years) based on an index of relative abundance from bat detectors, and subsequently by direct observation of the remaining individuals at a single roost. In January 2009, the total known adult population was four individuals and the estimated population was considered to be fewer than 20 individuals. By August 2009, only one remaining individual was found during an extensive survey, which was recorded consistently each day in its foraging and roosting areas. This individual disappeared on 27 August 2009 and no individuals have been located since, despite extensive searching using proven techniques.&#160;</p>","<p><em>Pipistrellus murrayi</em> roosted under bark, in dead foliage, and in tree hollows. Maternity roosts were discovered in late 2005 under shedding bark of dead forest trees (<em>Tristiropsis acutangula</em> and <em>Inocarpus fagifer</em>), many of which were heavily decayed and collapsed soon after (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Females formed colonies of up to approximately 50 individuals, while males often roosted solitarily (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2007). Generation length of this species was likely to be 4-5 years. This species roosted in mature, tropical, evergreen, closed canopy rainforests and mature, tropical, semi-deciduous rainforests (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). It foraged in and over these forests and also along tracks, and in and over secondary forests and thickets of woody weeds (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). It fed on a range of small flying invertebrates, predominantly moths, beetles, and flying ants (Lumsden and Schulz 2009).<br/></p>","<p>The reasons for the decline and ultimate extinction of <em>P. murrayi</em> remain unclear. While habitat loss may have caused some declines in the past, 75% of Christmas Island is covered by primary or secondary rainforest, with little change in the amount of available habitat during the period of decline. Furthermore, most of the species’ range was within a National Park. The major threats to the species may have included predation or disturbance to bats within their roosts from introduced species, e.g. Common Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon capucinus</em>), Feral Cat (<em>Felis catus</em>), Black Rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and Giant Centipede (<em>Scolopendra subspinipes</em>) (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although not considered the primary cause of decline, as the spatio-temporal pattern did not closely match the pipistrelle’s decline, a series of recent population explosions of Yellow Crazy Ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) is likely to have led to some habitat change, likely decline in invertebrate prey resources, and may also have disturbed individuals at roost sites. It is also possible that some disease may have contributed to the decline, however, individuals captured over the period of decline appeared to be in good health, with the exception of low white blood cell counts, although the significance of these findings was unclear (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even the last known individual appeared to behave normally before it vanished.<br/></p>",Yes,Yes,"2 Extinction cause specied as unknown, or similar.","Because <em>Pipistrellus murrayi</em> was the only echolocating bat on Christmas Island, ultrasonic bat detectors were an effective technique for documenting its status, as it was readily recorded and could not be confused with, or obscured by, other species. Intensive detector sampling over many years (intermittent between the mid-1990s and 2004, and then almost continuous until and after its extinction) has provided an unusually detailed documentation of its decline, resulting in it being one of the most intensely monitored bat species on the planet.<br/><br/>Although there were no reliable population estimates, <em>P. murrayi</em> was reported to be abundant and widespread across Christmas Island at the time of its first settlement (1890s) (Andrews 1900), and was still abundant and widespread at the time of the first substantial study of it in 1984 (Tidemann 1985). By 1994 its range had contracted away from the north-east section of the island (which is where the only town is located), its distribution had become patchy, and it had started to decline in abundance (Lumsden and Cherry 1997). Between 1994 and 1998 there was a further westward range contraction and an apparent mean reduction of 33% in relative abundance, although this was not statistically significant (Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 1999, Schulz and Lumsden 2004). Between 1998 and 2004 there was a decline of between 55 and 65% in relative abundance and a continuing westward contraction of range of about 25 to 50% (James 2005). This decline continued and the species was then (<em>ca</em> 2007) considered to be confined to the far west of the island, no longer occurring across more than 90% of its former range (James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Long-term monitoring using bat detectors indicated this species underwent a 90% decline in abundance between 1994 and 2006 (James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden <em>et al</em>. 2007). This decline continued at a severe and consistent rate with the species disappearing from many of the few remaining sites where it was present in 2006 (Parks Australia North Christmas Island unpub. data).<br/><br/>In December 2008, the remaining <em>P. murrayi</em> population was thought to be restricted to a single foraging area and a single roost area (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Although the remaining single known roost site had previously contained as many as 50 individuals, by January 2009 there were only four adults present. The behaviour of these individuals suggested that they were lactating females with four dependent young in the roost. The total population was then estimated to be fewer than 20 individuals in order to account for the possibility of small undetected colonies (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Lumsden and Schulz (2009) stated that the January findings indicated that without urgent intervention there was an extremely high risk that the species would become extinct in the near future. While it could not be precisely predicted when this would occur if there was no intervention, it was predicted that this could occur within the following six months.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this predicted extinction of the species was realised. After the January findings, approval was urgently sought to capture the remaining individuals for a captive breeding program, the details of which had been outlined in a feasibility report (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Rather than acting immediately the Australian government established an Expert Working Group, and waited for its report in July 2009 (Beeton <em>et al</em>. 2009) before approving this intervention. In August 2009, a team of bat experts and captive breeding specialists attempted to take the remaining individuals into captivity. During the four weeks of intensive sampling, which employed 30 bat detectors each night to document the location of the remaining individuals, only one individual could be found, and despite extensive trapping efforts using standard and innovative techniques, it evaded all attempts to catch it (Lumsden 2009). On 27 August 2009 this individual also disappeared, and all survey and trapping attempts since that night have failed to detect the species. This is one of the few times that an extinction of a species in the wild can be marked to the day. The failure of the responsible agencies and managers to act quickly in response to the evidence of the rapid population decline is considered to have contributed to the extinction of this species (Lunney <em>et al</em>. 2011, Martin <em>et al</em>. 2012).",,,Australia,,,,Christmas Island,1888,No,81061,,Yes,Yes,,"<span lang=""EN-AU"">This species was endemic to Christmas Island (<span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU"">approximately 135 km² in area), <span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU"">Australia, which is in the eastern Indian Ocean.

It was endemic to New Zealand, where it  was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the  North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement  in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued  rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some  streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North  Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas,  it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely  encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to  the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not  noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn  and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again  in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a  variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The  roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of  factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration  of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover  resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature  and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).",Yes,Yes,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"This species&#160;was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s.

Juveniles were last recorded in the upper reaches of the river in 1992, suggesting that few individuals might have been able to survive and reproduce above the dam.

It was terrestrial, climbed trees, and was present all over the island, which was at the time mostly covered by tropical moist forest. Lister (1888) noted that ""they generally keep to the ground, but are able to climb trees."" Andrews (1900), who apparently was more impressed by their climbing ability, said they ""ascend trees to a great height"" in pursuit of fruits and young shoots, and ""I have often seen them run up the trailing stems of the lianas, and, in fact, they can climb as well as a squirrel."" Little is known of their diet, except that they were fond of fruits and young shoots.<br/>Nothing more is known about the habitat and ecology of this species aside from what is contained in the following lines: ""In the daytime these rats live in holes among the roots of trees, in decaying logs, and shallow burrows. They seem to breed all the year round"" (Andrews 1900).","This species was still abundant in 1897-1898 while Andrews was on Christmas Island (Andrews 1900). By the time he returned to the island in 1908, he was confident that it and the other native rat species, <em>Rattus nativitatis</em>, were extinct (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) speculated that introduced Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> had brought an epidemic disease to the island that wiped out both native rats. Nearly 100 years later, the mystery was finally solved by Wyatt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008), who used ancient DNA methods on samples from museum specimens of these rodents collected during the extinction window (AD 1888–1908), and showed that endemic rats collected prior to the introduction of Black Rats were devoid of evidence of a pathogenic trypanosome (carried by fleas hosted on recently-introduced Black Rats). <br/><br/>To Andrews, the disappearance of such an abundant animal in such a short time had to be due to disease because <em>R. rattus</em> was not present over the entire island. It was unreasonable therefore to assume that the native species had been out-competed by <em>R. rattus</em> all over the island (Andrews 1909). Two predators had been introduced to the island by 1908, cat and dog, but these were far too few to rid the island of the rats (Andrews 1900, 1909). Although Christmas Island had an increasing human settlement at Flying Fish Cove, roads now crossed the island, and there was active phosphate mining, there was still a lot of native forest and even collectively these human disturbances were unlikely to have caused significant declines in the populations of Maclear's Rat (Andrews 1909). Andrews (1909) also relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904. <br/><br/>Pickering and Norris (1996) report on documents concerning Maclear's Rat that were uncovered at Oxford University, and specimens from the Zoological Collections, University Museum, Oxford University and the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge. The documents include notes for a lecture by K. R. Hanitsch who visited Christmas Island for five weeks in 1904 and was unable to locate either species of native rat. Dr. Durham, a pathologist, visited the island from November 1901 to March 1902 and reported in expedition reports that he was told that <em>R. rattus</em> had been introduced to the island in 1899 by the S.S. Hindustan. Durham also collected 19 rat specimens. Pickering and Norris (1996) note that some of these specimens were of <em>R. macleari</em>, <em>R. rattus</em>, and some of varying degrees of hybrid between <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>. Hybridisation between the two species, with the implication that <em>R. macleari</em> was genetically swamped by <em>R. rattus,</em> was put forward as a contributing factor in the demise of <em>R. macleari</em> (Pickering and Norris 1996). However, hybridisation between the two species is unlikely given the phylogenetic distance between them, and apparently re-examination of specimens confirms that each belongs to one or the other species (Musser and Carleton 2005; Aplin 2008). This is further supported by the molecular studies of Wyatt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008).<br/><br/>Because Durham collected specimens, some of which were <em>R. macleari</em>, in late 1901 and 1902, <em>R. macleari</em> must have become extinct after 1901. <br/><br/>McDougal was the last person to recall seeing native rats alive, albeit in the act of dying (Andrews 1909). These rats were probably <em>R. macleari</em> because <em>R. nativitatis</em> was the rarer of the two, as evidenced by the fact that Durham was unable to collect any specimens of <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1901-1902. Andrews (1909) writes that McDougal's recollections are from 5-6 years before, but it is unclear whether he meant 5-6 years prior to his 1909 publication (putting the date at 1903-1904), or if it was 5-6 years prior to 1908 when Andrews was on Christmas Island (putting the date as 1902-1903 as Pickering and Norris (1996) interpret the anecdote). Because Hanitsch was unable to locate the species in 1904, it is likely that the species already had become extinct.<br/>Green (2014) further defined the date of introduction of black rats (and hence trypanosomes) (September 1900) and the extinction of <em>R. macleari </em>(between April 1904 and October 1904).",Yes,No,6 Clear justification of specific extinction cause,"Maclear's Rat became extinct probably between 1902 and 1904. It was, however, abundant on Christmas Island at the close of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Lister visited the island in 1887 and said of Maclear's Rat, it ""abounds all over the island"" (Lister 1888). Andrews (1900) who was on the island for ten months, 1897-1898, noted that it was ""by far the commonest of the mammals found in the island; in every part I visited, it occurred in swarms. During the day nothing is to be seen of it, but soon after sunset numbers may be seen running about in all directions."" Andrews continued by stating that ""as may be imagined, they are a great nuisance, entering the tents or shelters, running over the sleepers, and upsetting everything in their search for food"" (Andrews 1900).",,,Australia,,,,Christmas Island,1888,No,81061,149.96,Yes,Yes,,"Maclear's Rat was endemic to Christmas Island, Australia.

Its short tail and robust hands and feet demonstrate that it was equipped for life as a fossorial species (Thomas 1888, Forsyth Major 1900). It is interesting, however, that its skull was described as ""particularly small, slender, and delicate"" (Thomas 1888).<br/><br/>In any case, the species was often seen in and around burrows, and, unlike <em>R. macleari</em>, it did not climb trees. Andrews (1900) summed up what he knew of the animal: ""They seem to live in small colonies in burrows, often among the roots of a tree, and occasionally several may be found living in the long, hollow trunk of a fallen and half-decayed sago-palm (<em>Arenga listeri</em>). The food consists of wild fruits, young shoots, and, I believe, the bark of some trees.""","This species was last recorded by Andrews from his 10 month stay on Christmas Island 1897-1898 (Andrews 1900). At that time, it already appeared to be in decline. Although the species was known from the settlement at Flying Fish Cove, Andrews never encountered them there and believed they were mainly confined to higher ground (Andrews 1900, 1909). In the hills, he described them as ""very numerous in places"", but less common than <em>R. macleari</em> (Andrews 1900). Andrews (1900) states that ""it is difficult to avoid the belief that the former species [<em>R. nativitatis</em>] is being supplanted by the latter [<em>R. macleari</em>] in spite of the abundance of food.""<br/><br/>By the time Andrews revisited the island in 1908, he was confident in pronouncing the species to be extinct (Andrews 1909). In 1904, Hanitsch visited the island hoping to collect specimens of the native rats, but was unable to locate either species (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). Durham visited the island in November of 1901 to March 1902 and collected <em>R. macleari</em> and <em>R. rattus</em>, but was unable to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em>, despite offering a reward to the local inhabitants (Pickering and Norris 1996; see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). Pickering and Norris (1996) note that Durham did not go far from Flying Fish Cove during his stay, thus he could well have missed <em>R. nativitatis</em>. However, Hanitsch's failure to obtain <em>R. nativitatis</em> in 1904 likely means that the species was extinct by this time. Andrews (1909) relates anecdotal information that a medical officer on the island, Dr. McDougal, recalled frequently seeing ""individuals of the native species of rats crawling about the paths in the daytime, apparently in a dying condition"" in 1902-1904, and these may have included <em>R. nativitatis</em>, but were likely to be <span style=""font-style: italic;"">R. macleari</span> (see account for <em>R. macleari</em> for further details). <br/><br/>The demise of the Bulldog Rat was certainly rapid, going from locally common to extinct in less than eight years. It is thought to have been the result of an epidemic disease brought to the island by introduced Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em> (Andrews 1909; Aplin 2008). Black Rats are thought to have been introduced to the island by the S.S. Hindustan in 1899 (Pickering and Norris 1996) - subsequently determined to be September 1900 by Green (2014).

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer <em>et al.</em> 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). <br/><br/>Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species&#160;was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.<br/><br/>Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler <em>et al.</em> 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower <em>Ageratina riparia</em>), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines <em>et al. </em>1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.",Yes,Yes,"2 Extinction cause specied as unknown, or similar.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common.

This species experienced a very rapid decline, from being common to extinct in less than a year, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This was a mostly aquatic species largely restricted to the shallow section of fast-flowing creeks and streams in rainforest. It was only recorded from pristine rainforest where there was no disturbance. Males would call in summer along the edge of creeks and streams. It was one of only two known species to brood its offspring within its stomach. Females deposited their eggs, and then swallowed them. While in the stomach, tadpoles excreted some form of enzyme that inhibited the female's gastric digestion, and then proceeded to develop into fully formed froglets. The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984–1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990). However, despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded within Eungella National Park or any other locations since March 1985 (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993; Hero <em>et al.</em> 1998, 2002; McDonald and Alford 1999).

All are members of the so-called '<em>Salmo trutta</em>'   (brown trout) complex', which is widely distributed across much of the   Palearctic region. However, taxonomic classification within this  complex  remains a matter of discussion due to its complicated  evolutionary  history and inherent phenotypic diversity. While a  consensus regarding  the existence of several distinct phylogeographic  lineages (Atlantic,  Duero, Mediterranean, Adriatic, Marmoratus,  Danubian and Tigris) has  been reached, the evolutionary relationships  between them remain  unclear. In northwest Africa, mitochondrial and  nuclear DNA analyses  have revealed the existence of three major clades  which derived from  multiple waves of ancient colonisation; (1) an  Afro-Atlantic clade  inhabiting Mediterranean coastal rivers of North  Africa and the Sous  River system in Atlantic Morocco, stemming from a  colonisation wave of  the Atlantic lineage from Iberia, (2) a relict and  native clade  inhabiting the Draa River in Atlantic Morocco and (3) a  native Atlas  Mountains clade which probably arose from a reticulate  evolutionary  event, following invasion by Atlantic trout that  introgressed into local  populations.<br/><br/>The drawing of concrete  conclusions is complicated,  however, because the stocking of hatchery  trout appears to have driven  significant introgression in some  populations. Furthermore, the <em>Salmo trutta</em>  complex reaches the  southern limit of its natural range in northwest  Africa, and most  rivers in the region are too warm to support trout  populations. Those  populations that do exist are mostly confined to high  altitude streams  and lakes, or perennial headwaters of short  Mediterranean rivers. This  degree of isolation, coupled with the  relatively extreme environmental  conditions, has permitted localised  adaptation and morphological  differentiation which is not necessarily  reflected in distinct genetic  signatures. In fact, the population  inhabiting the Draa River   constitutes the only case in which a fully preserved indigenous genetic   signature has been detected. Additional research employing a broader   genomic survey has therefore been recommended to more clearly elucidate   the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between northwest African <em>Salmo</em> populations.<br/><br/><em>Salmo pallaryi</em> has not been included in any DNA analysis, but is likely to have belonged to the Atlas Mountains clade given the location of its only known population.",,

Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). The usually successful hunter Arthur S. Vernay made three trips to Thailand specifically for the species, the first in 1920, but failed to see the species. There are some hundreds of skulls, frontlet and antlers in collections (Harper 1945), but the species is now extinct.",,,,,,,Thailand,,,,107626.42,No,No,,"<em>Rucervus schomburgki</em> was endemic to Thailand and is thought to have become extinct when the last captive individual was killed in 1938; the last known wild animals were killed in 1932 near Sai Yoke and Kwae Yai, although this date was not universally accepted at the time (Harper 1945, Lekagul and McNeely 1988). The recent range in Thailand seems to have lain within 13°30′–18°N, 98°30′–102°E, comprising the central plain of Thailand (Giles 1937, Harper 1945, G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Attempts to circumscribe the range have, however, been bedevilled by a surprisingly large number of statements of occurrence elsewhere.<br/><br/>Statements of occurrence in the Sanda Valley, Yunnan, China by Sclater (1891: 180) and Bentham (1908) led to this locality being included without any caveat by Grubb (2005), and relate to both a frontlet and a skin. However, Sclater (1891) listed the set of antlers as of unknown locality, and the skin has a ""?"" mark that makes its Sanda Valley locality no more than tentative (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Then, Bentham (1908) indicated that the antlers had been collected in the Sanda Valley by John Anderson in 1878, without giving explicit source for this statement. In fact, Anderson was in the Sanda Valley in 1868, not 1878, and moreover recorded no such antlers in his thorough write-up of zoological results of his Yunnan expeditions. This locality assignment for the antlers should be seen as an error of Bentham's, presumably stemming from the earlier, tentative, assignment of Sanda Valley to the deer skin Sclater also reported (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Pocock (1943) included under distribution of the species “N. Siam [Thailand] and, it has been alleged, Yunnan and Lao PDR”, indicating his own concern with the Sanda valley ‘evidence’. The Shan states (Myanmar) have also figured as part of the species’s range, e.g. by Blanford (1891: 540). Reference to historical occurrence in these areas seems to stem from Brooke (1876), who wrote, based on written communication from a Dr Campbell of the Bangkok British Consulate) in reference to new specimens sent to him that "". . . all specimens were procured in northern Siam, probably even in the tributary states named Laos and Shan"". Campbell seems to have based his opinion at least partly on what professional indigenous hunters told him or others. Brooke gave no definition of ""northern Siam"" (conceivably it simply meant some way north of Bangkok), and Lao PDR in this context could well have included part or all of the Korat Plateau and other areas in present-day Thailand which are ethnically Lao and were often referred to in the past by terms such as ‘Siamese Laos’. It is not even clear that Lao PDR and Shan were not just speculation on the part of Campbell and/or Brooke (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Harper (1945) considered the Shan states report to be “highly indefinite” and occurrence in “Indo-China” [presumably = Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam] to be “in error”, although he took the ‘Sanda valley’ frontlet as “apparently authentic”, perhaps being focussed on the identity (which is not in doubt) rather than the provenance (presumably assuming that the association with the highly-respected Anderson’s name was enough). A more modern reanalysis concluded that ""the northern Thailand, Myanmar, Yunnan, and Lao PDR range extensions suggested in the literature are based on erroneous or quite inconclusive items of evidence"", sometimes perhaps influenced by a switch of Thai names between Eld’s and Schomburgk’s Deer by Flower (1900) (G.J. Galbreath <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Two loose antlers, presumed to be a pair, of Schomburgk’s Deer photographed in Phongsali province, far northern Lao PDR, in 1991 were a most surprising find. This has been taken to suggest the species might survive, at least into the 1980s, and that it did indeed occur in Lao PDR (Schroering 1995) and it was even taken as sufficient evidence that the species was not extinct by MacPhee and Flemming (1999). However, while these are indeed Schomburgk’s Deer antlers, it has proven impossible to recover a consistent story from their owner of the antlers’ origin (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999) and there is no compelling evidence that they had come from a recently killed animal, rather than being decades-old stock still in trade; Williams (1941) noted that even then that Schomburgk’s Deer antlers ""keep coming down to Bangkok from Paknampo and Korat by railway amongst collections of ordinary deer-horns consigned to Bangkok Chinamen . . . the horns are probably quite old . . ."" and Schomburgk’s Deer antlers are still in trade in Thailand (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992). The owner of the antlers was, according to his daughter, a middleman trader in wildlife parts sourced from all over Indochina (W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2008, based on visit in 1996). Consequently, while remains of the species have been seen in Lao PDR in recent times, they cannot be taken as evidence that the species survives today, or ever occurred in Lao PDR.","Relics of this extinct species (usually antlers) are still traded to a limited extent. During its last few decades of existence Schomburgk's Deer was hunted heavily, presumably for meat, and certainly for antlers which went into the Chinese medicine trade (e.g. Williams 1941, Harper 1945).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"As an extinct species there are no appropriate conservation measures. The indication that a remnant population might still survive (Schroering 1995 and <em>in litt</em>. as reported in Grubb 2005, MacPhee and Flemming 1999) was followed up by investigation, independently by several people, of Phongsali province, Lao PDR, by field survey and interview. This failed to find any further evidence of the species there or to elicit a consistent story of the origin of the antlers (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, per J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Given regional trends in Schomburgk’s Deer’s sole known habitat, non-forest floodplains (its massive conversion to agriculture over the last 150 years) it is unlikely that the species could survive. However, any future indication of its existence should be followed up carefully.

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973).

In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards <em>et al.</em> 1993).

Small numbers of cultivated specimens have been replanted in wild situations since the 1980s, but many of these have fared poorly and no recruitment has been observed.","Even the basic ecology of the Redwood is now difficult to reconstruct, presenting a considerable obstacle to further conservation. Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) reported it to be a “middling-sized tree”. Plants today are slender, rarely exceed 3 m in height and usually do not survive for more than 20 years. It is quite possible that the typical growth form was stronger and more robust in the past, and the hard, red wood once used for construction purposes must have been harvested from much older specimens than those currently known (Cronk 1983). Flowering may occur throughout the year under favourable conditions, and the large, pendent blooms produce copious pollen and nectar. They are visited by a wide range on insects and are also self-fertile. Seed set is usually good but severe predation from mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) occurs in many places. The seed is moderately large and heavy with no obvious means of dispersal, though it is possible that it was once taken and distributed by forest birds which have long since died-out.","<p>The extinction of the Redwood from natural habitats was, primarily, almost certainly a result of deforestation. Following the establishment of a permanent colony on St Helena by the East India Company in 1659, the middle altitude zone of the island was rapidly cleared to make way for pasture and the forests were felled for timber and fuel. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>), which were then prevalent on the island, were probably responsible for uprooting large numbers of seedlings. By the mid 18<sup>th</sup> Century only small fragments of the original native woodlands remained, and these had vanished almost entirely by the early 1800s. With the exception of a few preserved stands of Gumwood (<em>Commidendrum robustum </em><span class=""authorship"">(Roxb.) DC.), no descriptions have survived&#160; of the original vegetation of this zone. It is known that Redwood timber was much sought after and the bark was used for tanning.<br/><br/>Today, there are considerable challenges in preserving the remaining vestiges of the species. All extant individuals are derived from a single tree. This severe genetic bottleneck appears to have resulted in serious inbreeding depression, with many rearing attempts failing because the plants die as saplings or exhibit severely retarded growth. It is also possible that the Redwood<em> </em>once formed specific mycorrhizal associations which have now been lost, and this could also impair survival. The adults are susceptible to pests and diseases, particularly Vine Weevils (<em>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</em> Fabricius), and seed predation by mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) is rife at some seed orchards. However, there is considerable variation in vigour between individuals, and small numbers grow into reasonably strong, shrubby trees exceeding two metres in height.</p>",No,No,5 Specific description,"Although a number of trees were present in gardens during the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century, the cultivated stock appears to have died-out and it is thought that the last wild tree at Peak Dale was the only surviving plant by 1950 (Cronk 2000). All extant specimens are now derived from seed collected from this individual. Cronk guessed that the cultivated population numbered around 60 plants in 2000, and it is likely that the total is approximately the same today.",,,St Helena,St Helena,No,1658,St Helena,,,,,Yes,Yes,,"The Redwood is endemic to St Helena, South Atlantic Ocean. It is no longer found in the wild but is cultivated in several places on the island.<br/><br/>Much uncertainty surrounds the original wild range of the species. Melliss (1875) reported wild trees at High Peak and Diana’s Peak, and since these locations hold the last fragments of indigenous cloud forest, it has often been assumed that the species belonged to this community. However, recent plantings in high altitude locations have not succeeded; repatriated individuals are vulnerable to strong winds and do not thrive in the very damp climate. It may therefore be significant that Melliss reported the plants to be found “in the glens”, perhaps instead suggesting a preference for the sub-montane belt between 550 and 700 m altitude. This zone appears to fit with the last known wild location, below High Peak at the head of Peak Dale Gut. Banks (1896) also asserted that they “refuse the highest ridges” and Roxburgh (see Beatson 1816) noted them “on moderately high hills”. On this assumption, it could be speculated that the range extended over parts of the upper mid-altitude zone of St Helena, particularly in sheltered valleys and on richer soils.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Experiments involving artificial selection have demonstrated that the health of the population can gradually be improved by careful manipulation (Rowe, 1995). Interspecific crosses between <em>T. erythroxylon</em> and the related Dwarf Ebony (<em>Trochetiopsis ebenus</em> Cronk) also produce fertile offspring with greatly increased vigour, and this could offer a possibility to accelerate the removal of deleterious alleles. A limited programme of back-crossing hybrids to <em>T. erythroxylon</em> parents has been conducted by Rebecca Cairns-Wicks. Thus far, F3 plants have been obtained, a few of which display very convincing redwood-like phenotypes, and maintain substantially increased growth rates (R. Cairns-Wicks pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>However, in order for such efforts to be successful, operations must be long-term and conducted on a much larger scale, as the small numbers of plants currently managed are very prone to accidental losses. In addition, it is important to preserve the genetic material from as many of the older plants as possible to avoid selective processes from further eroding the gene pool. Careful records of all crosses must be maintained so that genetic provenance can be traced.<br/><br/>A management plan has been produced (Cairns-Wick 2007), on which the above summary is based, but there are several barriers to achieving the goals. These include a lack of finances, local expertise, facilities and training. Furthermore, the short life cycle of today’s plants requires reasonably intensive efforts to replenish and increase the population. The situation is currently precarious: the ongoing programme is minimal, and&#160;periodic loss of trained staff and reallocation of budgets on St Helena could lead to further gaps, with serious consequences. As a safeguard against such problems, some seed has been placed in long-term storage, both on St Helena and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in the UK.</p>",Afrotropical,1950s,1955,FALSE,FALSE,Global,Melhania erythroxylon,Trochetiopsis erythroxylon,PLANTAE,TRACHEOPHYTA,MAGNOLIOPSIDA,MALVALES,MALVACEAE,Trochetiopsis,erythroxylon,,,,,(G.Forst.)

Although it is thought to have inhabited the most remote parts of St Helena, the likelihood of this distinctive species remaining undiscovered on a small and well-botanized island is very low.","All known localities occur in areas which are now extremely barren and arid, typically in dry coastal valleys or on screes and hills near the sea, 0 – 200 m altitude. It is somewhat difficult today to understand how a tree species, reputed to develop a trunk up to one metre in diameter, could have thrived in such inhospitable places, especially since most Dombeyoideae species are adapted to reasonably moist habitats. One explanation is that the climate in the lower valleys may have changed substantially around the time of human arrival – a factor which could have contributed to the demise of the species. However, there is no obvious evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, the very dense wood suggests that plants were extremely slow-growing, and this may indicate tolerance of extremely harsh conditions. The small, densely tomentose leaves also display a morphology typically adapted to minimize water loss.","The decline of the Ebony appears to have occurred soon after St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese fleet in 1502. It is highly likely that goat grazing played a major role in the demise. Goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) were introduced by early ships to provide meat, and rapidly multiplied into large flocks which caused extensive damage to the vegetation of dry areas. A settlement was not established on St Helena until 1659, yet large stands of dead Ebony Trees were discovered in Sandy Bay within 20 years, and were felled soon after to fuel a nearby lime kiln.

However, since the Ebony Tree was economically important it received occasional mentions in historical documents, and clues to its presence can still be found today in the form of fragments of semi-fossilized wood which still litter some of the drier seaward slopes.<br/><br/>From these indications, it appears that the species inhabited lowland areas of St Helena, especially along the south coast.

10838671,43993,Vanvoorstia bennettiana,,,,,Extinct,,2003,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The red alga <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has only ever been collected from two sites (in the world).  The initial discovery, the type locality, was from the seabed at the eastern end of Spectacle Island in Parramatta River sometime between the 1st and the 16th May in 1855.  This site is now operated by the Royal Australian Navy as an explosives storage (barge), administrative offices and a mooring site for destroyers and other large Naval vessels.  The shoreline has been altered and strengthened and the seabed is regularly dredged to allow ample draught for large ships.  This site was first surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards in December 1988.  Since then, seven dives during all seasons up until  23 April 2001, have been undertaken at that site.  No specimens have been discovered, and the only alga found there was a species of the genus <em>Sargassum</em>, that appears to tolerate low light, high nutrient, regularly disturbed conditions.
<br/>
<br/>The only other site known to have harbored this species was on the seabed between Point Piper and Shark Island in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour).  This was collected by Dr Ramsay of the Australian Museum in October 1886.  This site was also surveyed by myself and colleague Mr Peter Richards firstly in December 1988 then numerous times (approx 10) since.  The seabed in this area now has no solid rocky substrata to which any seaweed could attach, the sediment is approximately 1 m thick (a divers arm disappears to the shoulder) and is easily stirred up by divers and passing ferry traffic.  The surrounding rocky foreshore of both Point Piper and Shark Island have only small amounts of the kelp <em>Ecklonia radiata</em> and the green alga <em>Caulerpa filiformis</em> growing on them. Both are known to tolerate heavily disturbed conditions.  No specimens of <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> have been discovered.
<br/>
<br/>Within Parramatta River and Port Jackson proper, I have logged some 50 dives from 12 different sites, all of which have reasonable coverage of a few marine algal species typical of the NSW coastline.  Based on knowledge of two other species in the genus <em>Vanvoorstia</em>, in addition to known growth strategies and environmental preferences of other genera and species of the red algal family Delesseriaceae, to which <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> belongs, such areas should harbor this species.  In 1913, the then Curator of Algae at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, Arthur Lucas, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society of NSW in which he states ""I have never obtained it [<em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em>] either cast up or by dredging.""  He was an active collector of algae along the NSW coast up until his death in 1936.  The next Curator of Algae was Ms Valerie May who was also an active collector until her retirement in 1988, when I took over the position.  She was also unable to rediscover this species.
<br/>
<br/>Since 1980, I have logged in excess of 540 dives along the NSW coast as part of  a state government research priority to document the entire marine algal flora of the coast.  Our collections have come from Cape Howe in the very south of the state, to Cook Island on the Queensland/NSW border, with approximately 100 sites scattered in between.  The red algal species <em>Vanvoorstia bennettiana</em> has not been discovered during any of these dives.
<br/>
<br/>Several colleagues of mine from the universities of Southern Cross, New England, NSW, Sydney, and Wollongong, plus the Solitary Island Underwater Research Group (SURG), and the operators of every commercial dive shop I have worked through in NSW, have all been briefed on the identification of this and several other rare species of marine algae. None has reported a sighting during the 12 years I have been based at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. The genus is known to have an isomorphic alternation of generations.  This means that the haploid male and female macrophytic gametophytes are morphologically identical to the diploid macrophytic tetrasporophytes which they ultimately produce.  There is no crustose or resting stage in the life cycle of the species, which may have allowed it to lie dormant for many years until environmental conditions were favourable.  In short, both life stages are susceptible to the same environmental parameters.
<br/>
<br/>The Extinct category is used 'when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.' With negative data there can always be some doubt. And new species continue to be found in Australian marine waters, even in Sydney Harbour (J.R. Paxton in litt.). The presence of 15 individuals in one collection indicates that  the species was relatively common in at least one portion of Sydney Harbour at that time. Given the isomorphic alternation of generations, it seems most unlikely that the species would remain in existence and remain undetected for more than 100 years. Therefore as no specimens have been seen or collected in the intervening 116 years, despite numerous collections made by algologists in that period, the species can be considered truly Extinct.","Unknown at time of collection in 1855 and 1886.  The two sites, and much of Sydney Harbour, presently has soft sediment seabed with scattered rocky reef and rocky intertidal shores.  Scattered shells and solid waste products (cans, bottles etc.) also lie on the seabed.","Sydney Harbour is in the middle of the city of Sydney, the largest metropolis in Australia with more than 4 million people. In the 200+ years since settlement, the harbour has been seriously degraded by the population explosion. Use of the harbour as recreational facility, port, source of food, and sewer has seriously impacted on the native flora and fauna. Even by 1880, the harbour was found to be overfished by a Royal Commission. The Major Threats that may have caused the extinction of this alga include large and small scale fisheries particularly trawling, infrastructure development including industry, human settlement, tourism/recreation, water transport [including dredging for ship passage], fisheries- related bycatch by netting, and water pollution from agriculture, domestic, commercial/ industrial, oil, sedimentation, and sewage. The water quality of the harbour has improved since the 1972 passage of the New South Wales Clean Waters Act and the more recent removal of sewage outfalls some kilometers offshore. More fish species have moved to the upper estuarine portions of the Parramatta River and whales have returned to the outer harbour. However, for sessile species of limited distribution like Bennetts seaweed, swimming out of the harbour was not an option and the damage was done, permanently. As we do not even know in which decade the extinction occurred, we will never know which of the major threats was causative; a combination of a number of those listed is likely.

Paxton in litt.].",Yes,Yes,5 Specific description,,,,,,,,Australia,1788,Yes,,,Yes,No,,"First collected/discovered (1855) by crude dredging as a single individual plant from the east end of Spectacle Island, in the Parramatta River, Port Jackson, Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.

<br>
<br>There are now four species. Eric Coppejans (pers. comm.) indicates that there is  a new species he described from East Africa which is probably Critically Endangered: <i>Vanvoorstia incipiens</i> De Clerck, Wynne & Coppejans (<i>Phycologia</i> 38 (1999): 394-400). This newly described species  occurs massively in a single (rather small) bay along the east coast of Zanzibar, at about low tide level (large amounts drifting or entangled to other seaweeds in intertidal pools). Coppejans carried out over 200 collecting excursions along the Kenyan, Tanzanian (incl. Zanzibar) coast and NEVER found a single specimen anywhere else than the type locality, where we find it again year after year. It doesn't occur in the neighbouring bays, which look ""identical"" to this one! If that bay would be disturbed (harbour, oil pollution, etc.) the only known (type) locality  would disappear and we would have a similar story there within the same genus!!

As a consequence of the occurrence of avian influenza in Europe in 2006, the Socorro Dove Project sent a total of 12 birds to Albuquerque Biological Park to form a second, independent reserve population nearer to the species's native country (S. G. Stadler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span>&#160;2012). The total captive population is currently estimated at approximately 150 individuals (J. E. Martínez-Gómez&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). In 2013 and again in 2014 a number of birds were transferred to Mexico to form a national captive breeding flock ahead of efforts to eventually return the species to Socorro Island (H. Horblit&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013, J. E.

It was formerly common and observations in 1957 and 1958 gave no indication that it was declining. The last sighting in the wild was in 1972 (Baptista and Martínez-Gómez 1996)<strong></strong>, and all suitable habitat on the island has been surveyed subsequently without recording the dove (J. E. Martínez-Gómez <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria recognised a breeding programme for the species, as initiated by Cologne and Frankfurt zoos (Germany) and the private interest group Wild Pigeons and Doves, as an official European Endangered species programme (EEP), in 1995 (Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Modern studbook software has been employed to assist with the genetic and demographic management of the captive population. Individuals have been distributed to zoos and bird parks in countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, U.K., Poland, Austria, Luxembourg, France, Spain, the Czech Republic and Germany (S. G. Stadler<em> in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, 2012)<strong></strong>. Of 672 individuals listed in the studbook by December 2010, 102 were known to be alive (S. G. Stadler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Since 2006, following an extensive survey of the origin of the founding individuals of the EEP population, major software-based population genetic analyses have been conducted and recommendations for new pairs have been given by the EEP coordinator (S. G. Stadler<em> in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, 2012)<strong></strong>. A special breeding unit for the species has been opened at Marlow Bird Park, Germany (Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. A proposal has been developed to reintroduce the species (Baptista and Martínez-Gómez 1996, Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003, S. G. Stadler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>, along with a restoration programme for Socorro (Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Horblit <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. DNA fingerprinting has revealed extensive hybridisation with <em>Z. macroura</em> in the U.S.A., however it also showed a high degree of relatedness between the European population and pure individuals kept in California (Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. As a result, the European population will be used for reintroduction efforts. The construction of breeding aviaries on Socorro began in August 2003 (Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong> and was completed by 2005 (Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005a)<strong></strong>. Resident populations of <em>Z. macroura</em> and Common Ground-dove <em>Columbina passerina</em> (Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005a)<strong></strong> were screened in December 2003 and January 2004 to assess the presence of pathogens that might affect the reintroduction programme (Martínez-Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b)<strong></strong>. Avian malaria and trichomoniasis were detected in both species, and as a result recommendations were put forward (Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b)<strong></strong>. In 2005, plans were outlined to control the locust outbreaks, restore native vegetation and assess the problem of erosion (J. E. Martínez-Gómez <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. The arrival on Socorro of the first birds from the EEP was planned for June 2005 (Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005b)<strong></strong>, with the establishment of a breeding flock by June 2006 (Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005a, S. G. Stadler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. However, there have been problems with import restrictions and permits (J. E. Martínez-Gómez <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In the face of these restrictions a small insurance population was established in the U.S.A. in 2008 (H. Horblit <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, J. E. Martínez-Gómez <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, forming the basis for the return of the species to Africam Safari Zoo, Puebla, Mexico (S. G.

Two groups of birds were transferred to Mexico in 2013 and 2014 to form the basis of a population for eventual reintroduction to Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Control of feral cats has been undertaken on Socorro ( B. Tershy <em>in litt</em>. 1999) although despite over over five hundred cats being killed on the island between 2011-2016, they still persist throughout the island in low numbers (B. Tershy<em>&#160;in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span>&#160;2007, J. E. Martínez-Gómez&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016, Ortíz-Alcaraz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017,&#160;Lowen 2020). Furthermore, over 1,700 feral sheep were culled on the island between 2009-2012 (Ortíz-Alcaraz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016) and as of 2012, sheep were completely eradicated from the island, facilitating a rapid, remarkable recovery in local vegetation cover (Ortíz-Alcaraz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lowen 2020). Reports that rats have recently colonised Socorro have proved to be unfounded (J. E. Martínez-Gómez&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999, 2000) although mice remain an issue on the island and must be removed due to their predation of dove chicks (J. Lowen <em>in litt.</em> 2020). Techniques to grow four endemic tree species from Socorro have been successful, with 117 tree seedlings planted on the island. These restored areas will be important when birds are eventually released back onto Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;The species is included on the 'Watch List' of the State of North America's Birds as a species of high conservation concern (NABCI 2016).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Import birds from the EEP and establish a breeding flock on Socorro (Bell <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b, J.
